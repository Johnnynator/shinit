# shinit

`shinit` is a simplified replacement for cloud-init that does much
less and for fewer clouds.  Here's a logo to help you remember this
project:

## Why?

Its dramatically simpler and works without Python.  Adding a new
provider is as simple as writing a short shell script.

## Limitations?

Probably many, mostly that it isn't compabible with as much stuff as
cloud-init is, and it doesn't do as much with the data either.
